```text
create a hello world rust program
```

answer:

To create a "Hello, World!" program in Rust, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file with the extension `.rs`, for example, `hello_world.rs`.
2. Write the following code in the file:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

3. Save the file.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `hello_world.rs` file is located.
5. Compile the Rust program using the `rustc` command followed by the file name: `rustc hello_world.rs`. This will generate an executable binary file.
6. Run the compiled binary by typing `./hello_world` on Linux or macOS, or `.\hello_world.exe` on Windows.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `fn main() { ... }`: This is the `main` function, which acts as the entry point of every Rust program.
- `println!("Hello, World!");`: This line uses the `println!` macro to print the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

After following these steps, you should see the output "Hello, World!" in the terminal[1][2].
